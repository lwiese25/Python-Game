# Overview
I created this racing game for my final project in my game development class. It is inspired by Galaga and Donkey Kong. I chose this game style because it made me think of the classic games that were first made for the Atari and NES. This game showcases front-end techniques within Python libraries, as well as object management, including collisions, run-time, and memory allocation.

## Installation
Please download the zip file to run the game properly. It includes all of the images and sounds needed. Make sure the sound and image files are in the same folder as the Python file so the game loads properly.
